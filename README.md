# Take home assessment for PermitFlow

### Author: Thomas Grundy

### Short description of approach taken
I have short descriptions for this project, split into two README.md files, in the backend and frontend folders.

Here's the unlisted YouTube video of me running through it: https://youtu.be/Yh8_QAqwB6o 

### How to build/run

**backend**
- `npm install` should install dependencies.
- `npm run build` will compile up all that Typescript goodness if you're feeling like it.
- `npm dev` runs the server.
- `npm test` run the tests.

**frontend**
Same as above
- `npm install` should install dependencies.
- `npm run build` will compile up all that Typescript goodness if you're feeling like it.
- `npm dev` runs the server.
- `npm test` run the tests.
